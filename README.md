# RAG-TACS: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Technical AWS Cloud Support - A chatbot

**RAG-TACS** is a cloud-based platform developed for the **Advanced Cloud Architecting** Midterm project at Dalhousie University. The system delivers an AI-powered Technical Support Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), integrating Sentence-Transformers for embedding generation and DistilGPT-2 for context-aware responses to assist with AWS-related technical queries. The primary goal is to provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated support, designed for technical users needing quick resolutions (e.g., S3 access issues, DynamoDB troubleshooting) and capable of handling moderate traffic with an average response time of 4.8 seconds.
