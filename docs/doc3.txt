Problem: DynamoDB throws ProvisionedThroughputExceededException during reads or writes.
Solution:
1. Switch to on-demand capacity mode if using provisioned capacity.
2. Increase read/write capacity units (RCU/WCU) if using provisioned mode.
3. Implement exponential backoff in your application to retry requests.
4. Analyze CloudWatch metrics to identify hot partitions and redistribute data.
