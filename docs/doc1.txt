Problem: S3 Access Denied Error (403) when accessing objects.
Solution:
1. Check the S3 bucket policy to ensure the IAM role or user has s3:GetObject permission.
2. Verify that Block Public Access settings are not overly restrictive if the object needs to be public.
3. Ensure the correct ARN is specified in the policy (e.g., arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*).
4. If using CloudFront, confirm the Origin Access Identity (OAI) is correctly configured.
