Problem: Invoking a SageMaker endpoint results in a timeout error.
Solution:
1. Ensure the SageMaker endpoint is in a private subnet with a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.
2. Verify the security group allows inbound HTTPS (port 443) from the Lambda function.
3. Check the endpoint status in the SageMaker console (should be "InService").
4. Increase the timeout in the Lambda function invoking the endpoint.
