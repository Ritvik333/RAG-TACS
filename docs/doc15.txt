Problem: DynamoDB items are not expiring despite TTL being enabled.
Solution:
1. Verify the TTL attribute (e.g., timestamp) is in Unix epoch time format (seconds).
2. Ensure TTL is enabled on the table and the correct attribute is specified.
3. Wait up to 48 hours, as TTL deletions are not immediate.
4. Check CloudWatch Logs for any TTL-related errors or misconfigurations.
