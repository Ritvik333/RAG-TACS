Problem: CloudFront serves outdated content after updating S3 files.
Solution:
1. Create an invalidation in CloudFront to refresh the cache (e.g., /* for all files).
2. Adjust the TTL settings in CloudFront to reduce caching duration.
3. Ensure the updated files are uploaded to the correct S3 bucket and path.
4. Verify the CloudFront distribution has finished deploying after changes.
