Problem: S3 upload fails with an Invalid Signature error.
Solution:
1. Ensure your AWS credentials (access key/secret key) are correct and not expired.
2. Check the system clock on your machine; a time skew can cause signature issues.
3. Verify the region in your S3 client matches the bucket's region (e.g., us-east-1).
4. If using temporary credentials, ensure the session token is included in the request.
