Problem: S3 static website hosting endpoint returns 404 or 403 errors.
Solution:
1. Verify that static website hosting is enabled and the index document is set to index.html.
2. Check the bucket policy to allow public read access if needed.
3. Ensure the correct region is used in the endpoint URL (e.g., bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
4. Confirm that the files (e.g., index.html) are uploaded and publicly accessible.
