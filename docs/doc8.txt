Problem: SageMaker endpoint creation fails with a generic error.
Solution:
1. Check the IAM role for permissions to access S3 (for model data) and CloudWatch.
2. Verify the model data (.tar.gz) exists in the S3 bucket and is accessible.
3. Ensure the SageMaker instance type (e.g., ml.t3.medium) is available in your region.
4. Review CloudWatch Logs for detailed error messages (e.g., container issues).
