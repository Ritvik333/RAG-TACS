Problem: CloudFront distribution returns a 403 Access Denied error.
Solution:
1. Verify the S3 bucket policy allows the CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) to access objects.
2. Ensure the OAI is correctly configured in the CloudFront distribution settings.
3. Check that the S3 bucket objects are not encrypted with a key CloudFront can't access.
4. Confirm the default root object is set to index.html in CloudFront settings.
