Problem: Lambda function fails to invoke SageMaker endpoint (e.g., Access Denied).
Solution:
1. Ensure the Lambda IAM role has sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint permission.
2. Verify the SageMaker endpoint name in the Lambda code matches the deployed endpoint.
3. Check the security group rules to allow outbound HTTPS from Lambda to SageMaker.
4. Confirm both Lambda and SageMaker are in the same VPC and region.
