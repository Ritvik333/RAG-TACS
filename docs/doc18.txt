Problem: DynamoDB Scan operation returns no items despite data existing.
Solution:
1. Verify the table name and region are correct in the request.
2. Check for any FilterExpression that might exclude all items.
3. Ensure the IAM role has dynamodb:Scan permission for the table.
4. If using pagination, ensure you're handling the LastEvaluatedKey correctly.
