Problem: S3 bucket policy is not granting or denying access as expected.
Solution:
1. Check the policy syntax for errors using the AWS Policy Editor.
2. Ensure the ARN in the policy matches the bucket name (e.g., arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*).
3. Verify the Principal (e.g., IAM role ARN) is correct and exists.
4. Test the policy with the AWS Policy Simulator to debug permissions.
