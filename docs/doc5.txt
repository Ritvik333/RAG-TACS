Problem: Lambda function times out after the default 3 seconds.
Solution:
1. Increase the timeout setting in the Lambda configuration (e.g., to 15 seconds).
2. Check for network latency if the function accesses external services (e.g., DynamoDB, S3).
3. Ensure the function is in a VPC with access to required resources via NAT Gateway.
4. Optimize the function code to reduce execution time (e.g., cache connections).
